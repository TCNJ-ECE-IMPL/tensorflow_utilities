# IMPL TensorFlow Utilities

This repository contains the Python scripts and libraries needed to train, evaluate, and deploy Deep Convolutional Neural Network architectures using the TensorFlow library. These tools aim to make it easier to design, implement, and train models quickly by making easier to work with data sets. This is achieved by abstracting and encapsulating a data set into a Python class object, allowing machine learning engineers to focus on model development instead of data wrangling.

## General Installation and Set Up

These tools require Python 3.6 along with the Pip package manager. Installation instructions can be found [here](doc/INSTALLATION.md). If installing for the first time on the machine (not an IMPL Linux workstation) then follow the "First Time Installation and Set Up Procedure" section first, then follow the "General Installation Procedure".

The output should say all tests have been passed.
